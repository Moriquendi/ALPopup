### About

**ALPopupController** - library for displaying pop-up windows with a native style (AirPods, Wi-Fi password sharing etc).

The library supports 2 types of popup windows:

- ALCardController - card window located at the bottom of the screen
- ALPopupController - regular popup window located in the center of the screen

All controllers have ready-made templates for fast information display, smooth animations, iPad and Mac support, gesture closing, and much more customization. Can also be used with UINavigationController.  You can play around with the example app.

If you liked this library, please do not forget to put a `★ star`, it will help me in its development.
